    "To improve the team with keeping the payroll sufficient, a clustering analysis was done looking at NBA player performance and salary data for the 2025-26 season. The goal was to find players who produced strong results in relation to their salary, or how much it would cost to have them. These players were identified as the best fits, avoiding players that were overpaid or too poor of an athlete.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two datasets were combined looking at the salaries of NBA players as well as their performance statistics. In this analysis, points per game and total rebounds were assessed to look at how much each player contributed to their team. Then, salary was used to see which players are underpaid versus overpaid in relation to their skill/contribution to the team.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was standardized so the big salary numbers would not overpower the metrics used for the features like points per game and assists.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data was clustered to group players into categories based on how similar their performance statistics and salaries were. To find a good amount of clusters for the analysis, the Elbow Method and Silhouette Score were used and it was found that there were 3 clusters that showed the best results."
